# claude-weeek

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin for the [WEEEK](https://weeek.net) task tracker. Gives Claude direct read/write access to WEEEK projects, boards, and tasks — no context switching.

## Features

- **11 MCP tools** — 7 read (projects, boards, columns, tasks) + 4 write (create/update/move/complete tasks)
- **5 skills** — `/weeek-start`, `/weeek-today`, `/weeek-standup`, `/weeek-advance`, `/weeek-context`
- **2 passive hooks** — auto-detect a WEEEK task ID from the current branch (SessionStart) or commit message (PostToolUse), inject context for the agent without ever calling the API
- **Read/write split** — tools are grouped so reads can be auto-approved while writes stay gated
- **Token auth** — single `WEEEK_API_TOKEN` env var, never logged
- **Safe defaults** — list tools paginate (default 20, max 50) so responses stay under the 25k token MCP limit
- **Structured errors** — API failures return `isError: true` with a human-readable message, the server never crashes

## Getting a WEEEK API Token

1. Sign in to [WEEEK](https://weeek.net).
2. Open **Workspace settings → API**.
3. Generate a personal API token.
4. Treat it like a password — it grants full read/write access to your workspace. Rotate it if it leaks.

Export it before launching Claude Code so the plugin can read it from the environment:

```bash
export WEEEK_API_TOKEN="your-weeek-token-here"
```

## Installation

Install via the Claude Code plugin marketplace.

### 1. Add the marketplace

In Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add notcodev/notcodev-marketplace
```

### 2. Install the plugin

```
/plugin install claude-weeek@notcodev-marketplace
```

Claude Code will register the MCP server automatically. Restart the session if the tools don't appear immediately.

## Tools

All tools are prefixed `weeek_`. Read tools are side-effect free and safe for auto-approve. Write tools mutate WEEEK state and should prompt for user confirmation.

### Read tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `weeek_list_projects` | List projects in the workspace. Use FIRST to discover project IDs. |
| `weeek_get_project` | Get a single project's full details by ID. |
| `weeek_list_boards` | List boards inside a project. |
| `weeek_list_board_columns` | List columns (statuses) inside a board. Required before moving tasks. |
| `weeek_list_tasks` | List tasks with filters (project, board, column, assignee, completion) and pagination. |
| `weeek_get_task` | Get full details of a single task by ID. |

### Write tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `weeek_create_task` | Create a NEW task. Requires title + project_id. |
| `weeek_update_task` | Edit fields (title, description, priority, assignee, due date) of an existing task. |
| `weeek_move_task` | Move a task to a different board column (status change). |
| `weeek_complete_task` | Mark a task complete, or reopen a completed task. |

## Configuration

The plugin works out of the box. To customise behaviour for your team's process, drop a `.weeek.json` at the root of your repo. All fields are optional.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notcodev/claude-weeek/main/plugin/config.schema.json",
  "taskIdPatterns": ["WEEEK-(\\d+)"],
  "branchTemplate": "feature/WEEEK-{id}-{slug}",
  "defaultBoardId": 567,
  "defaultProjectId": 89,
  "statusHints": {
    "inProgress": ["In Progress", "Doing"],
    "review":     ["Review", "Code Review"],
    "testing":    ["Testing", "QA"],
    "done":       ["Done", "Completed"]
  }
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `taskIdPatterns` | Regex list (capture group 1 = numeric ID) used by SessionStart and PostToolUse hooks to extract task IDs from branch names and commit messages. **Replaces** the built-in defaults — does not extend. |
| `branchTemplate` | Template used by `/weeek-start` to suggest branch names. Placeholders: `{id}`, `{slug}`. |
| `defaultBoardId` / `defaultProjectId` | Skills use these as defaults instead of asking. |
| `statusHints` | Maps workflow stages to column-name candidates. The `/weeek-advance` skill uses these to label the menu of next stages. Multi-stage workflows (In Progress → Review → Testing → Done) are first-class. |

The `$schema` URL provides autocomplete and validation in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and Cursor.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/weeek-start <id>` | Pull task context, suggest branch, optionally move to In Progress. |
| `/weeek-today` | Your tasks today, grouped by project and column. |
| `/weeek-standup` | Yesterday / Today / Blockers from recent commits + WEEEK status. |
| `/weeek-advance` | Move task to next workflow stage. Supports multi-stage boards. |
| `/weeek-context <id>` | Read-only task summary. |

## Hooks

The plugin ships two passive hooks that never block tool calls:

- **SessionStart** — if your branch references a WEEEK task, the agent gets a hint to consider `weeek_get_task`.
- **PostToolUse on `git commit`** — if a commit message references a WEEEK task, the agent gets a hint about `/weeek-advance`.

Both hooks are silent until they detect a task ID. Errors never surface.

## Safety

- **Read/write separation:** read tools and write tools are registered in separate groups. Configure your MCP client to auto-approve reads while gating writes.
- **No delete operations:** v1 intentionally does not expose delete endpoints — too destructive for an AI agent.
- **Pagination defaults:** list tools default to 20 results (max 50) to stay under the 25,000 token MCP response cap.
- **Token handling:** `WEEEK_API_TOKEN` is read from the `env` block only. It is never logged, echoed, or included in error messages.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `WEEEK_API_TOKEN environment variable is required` | Export the token in the shell that launched Claude Code: `export WEEEK_API_TOKEN=...`. |
| `Invalid WEEEK_API_TOKEN` | Token is wrong, revoked, or expired — regenerate in WEEEK workspace settings. |
| Server disconnects immediately after starting | You are on Node < 20. Upgrade Node (`nvm install 20`) and relaunch Claude Code from the upgraded shell. |
| Tool returns "Resource not found (404)" | The ID doesn't exist in the workspace — list the parent resource first (e.g., `weeek_list_projects` before `weeek_get_project`). |

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/notcodev/claude-weeek.git
cd claude-weeek
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

Scripts:
- `pnpm build` — bundle to `dist/` via tsdown
- `pnpm dev` — run from source via `tsx`
- `pnpm lint` — ESLint (enforces no-console rule for stdio safety)
- `pnpm typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`
- `pnpm test` — vitest unit tests

To smoke-test the built binary:

```bash
pnpm build
WEEEK_API_TOKEN=test node dist/index.js
# server blocks on stdin — press Ctrl+C to exit
```

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- A WEEEK account with API access
